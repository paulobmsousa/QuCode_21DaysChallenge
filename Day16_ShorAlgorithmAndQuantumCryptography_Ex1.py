# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Define the number to factor (RSA uses large primes, we use a small example)
N = 15  # Example: Factoring 15 (3 √ó 5)

# Create and run Shor‚Äôs algorithm instance
shor_instance = Shor(N)

# Run the algorithm on Qiskit's simulator
simulator = Aer.get_backend("qasm_simulator")
result = shor_instance.run(simulator)

# Display results
print("Factors found by Shor's Algorithm:", result.factors)

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Why this matters for Cryptography:
print("\nüö® Shor's Algorithm can efficiently factor large numbers, which breaks RSA encryption!")
print("RSA relies on the difficulty of factoring large numbers for security.")
print("Quantum computers running Shor‚Äôs Algorithm will make classical cryptography obsolete.")

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Post-Quantum Cryptography:
